# Installing Nginx in Linux from Source
### Download Nginx Source
Login as **root** and do this:
#### Ubuntu
```shell
apt-get install libcurl4-dev
```
#### CentOS
```shell
yum install curl-devel
```
Then move to src folder (create it if you don't have it) and download the nginx source:

```shell
cd /usr/local/src
```
